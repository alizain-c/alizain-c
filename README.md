   Hey there! My name is Ali Zain Charolia (:sound:UGH-LEE-ZAYN). I'm a Junior at the University of Houston pursuing dual degrees in Computer Science & Mathematics along with a Minor in Business Administration. I'm currently a Back-end Engineer Intern at IBM. I'm also an incoming Software Engineer Intern at J.P.Morgan Chase & Co. Previously, I have interned at NASA and PROS, Inc. My interests include but are not only limited to Full Stack Development, Data Science & Machine/Statistical Learning, Cloud Computing, Topology & Graph Theory, Finance, and Entrepreneurship. In my free time, I like binge-watching netflix, playing video games, hanging out with friends, and of course, coding!
